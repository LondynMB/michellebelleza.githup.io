            <h2> About Me</h2>
            <p>At first i started drawing as a side hobby or to help distract myself from falling asleep during class.
                The things i drew ranges from video game characters, random made up stuffs or Original Character(OC)
                my friends or people on YT created. Over time, drawing became more than just a way to stop myself
                from dozing off during class to something that i would like to try to pursue as a career in the future.
                Even though i might not be able to succefully pursue it, i thought to myself, what's the harm in trying?
